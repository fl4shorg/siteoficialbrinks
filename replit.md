# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The application is built using modern React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing a component-based architecture pattern. The main architectural decisions include:

**Framework Choice**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Rationale**: React provides excellent component reusability and a mature ecosystem
- **Alternatives**: Vue.js or Angular were considered but React was chosen for its extensive community support

**Styling System**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system
- **Implementation**: Custom CSS variables for brand colors (Brinks blue, green, gold) with Roman imperial theming
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI elements
- **Rationale**: Provides rapid development with consistent design patterns

**State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Rationale**: Handles caching, synchronization, and background updates efficiently
- **Local State**: React useState and useContext for component-level state management

**Routing**: HashRouter from React Router
- **Rationale**: Suitable for single-page deployment without server-side routing configuration
- **Structure**: Simple routing with catch-all 404 handling

## Component Architecture

**Design Pattern**: Atomic design principles with reusable UI components
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, and main content sections
- **Feature Components**: BenefitsSection, GroupsSection, RequirementsSection, RulesSection
- **UI Components**: Custom implementations of buttons, cards, forms using Radix UI primitives

**Animation System**: Custom scroll-based animations with Intersection Observer
- **Implementation**: useScrollAnimation and useStaggeredAnimation hooks
- **Rationale**: Provides smooth user experience without external animation libraries

## Data Management

**API Integration**: External API for group data management
- **Data Flow**: Fetch group data from external endpoints, with local state management for UI interactions
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error boundaries and loading states

**Image Assets**: External image hosting for logos, banners, and group images
- **CDN Strategy**: Uses external image URLs (i.ibb.co) for asset delivery
- **Rationale**: Reduces bundle size and improves loading performance

## Build System

**Bundler**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Rationale**: Faster hot module replacement and better tree-shaking compared to Webpack
- **Optimization**: Terser minification with console removal for production builds

**TypeScript Configuration**: Lenient settings for rapid development
- **Settings**: Disabled strict null checks and unused variable warnings for development flexibility
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean import statements (@/ prefix)

## Development Workflow

**Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript support and React-specific rules
- **Configuration**: Custom rules with relaxed settings for development speed
- **Linting**: Automated code formatting and error detection

**Development Server**: Vite dev server with hot reload on port 5000
- **Configuration**: Allows external connections for development flexibility

# External Dependencies

## UI and Styling

- **Radix UI**: Complete set of accessible, unstyled UI primitives for complex components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Lucide React**: Icon library providing consistent iconography
- **class-variance-authority**: Runtime class name generation for component variants

## Data Fetching and State Management

- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management with caching and synchronization
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation support
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Validation resolver integration for forms

## Development and Build Tools

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking for improved code quality
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind integration

## Specialized Libraries

- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities
- **embla-carousel-react**: Carousel component for image galleries
- **input-otp**: OTP input component for authentication flows
- **next-themes**: Theme switching functionality for dark/light modes
- **sonner**: Toast notification system for user feedback
- **cmdk**: Command palette component for navigation
- **react-day-picker**: Date picker component for scheduling features

## External Services

- **Image Hosting**: i.ibb.co for storing and serving images (logos, banners, group images)
- **Font Delivery**: Google Fonts for Manrope font family
- **API Endpoints**: External REST APIs for group data and user management

The application is designed to be easily deployable as a static site with minimal external dependencies beyond the API services for dynamic content.
